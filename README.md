## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:krios2146/hangman_gleam.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd hangman_gleam
```

Follow the instructions on the [Gleam website](https://gleam.run/getting-started/installing/) to install it

Installation of the Gleam can be quite tricky so there is a compiled escript file in the repo - `hangman_gleam`. To run this file you just need to install Erlang, no Gleam needed. After Erlang installation you can run:

```bash
# Make the escript executable
chmod +x ./hangman_gleam

# Run the program
./hangman_gleam
```

If you installed Gleam you can run 

```bash
  gleam run
```
